CosyDVR Android application (the "APP"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the APP.

We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the APP. By using the APP, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

Information Collection And Use
------------------------------

While using our APP, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name ("Personal Information").

Log Data
--------

Like many app developers, we collect information that the APP sends whenever you install/uninstall our APP from Goolgle Play, F-Droid or other installation source ("Log Data") using Google Play analyzing services.

This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, crashes of our APP that you may encounter, the time and date of your install/uninstall activity and other statistics.

In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this.

Communications
--------------

We may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that can improve the APP or to acquire detailed crash reports if any.

Video and Audio Recording
--------------------------

The APP uses camera and microphone as it is its main purpuse. Data collected is stored on the device's internal or removable storage drive. Video and audio data may be collected in background mode as it is one of the main APP's features. No recorded data is sent over the Internet.

Location
--------

The APP has access to location services. GPS data is stored on the device's internal or removable storage drive as well as Video and Audio data. No collected data is sent over the Internet.

Security
--------

The APP doesn't send any Personal Information over the Internet itself but the third party services such as Google Analytics may send some Personal Information during install/uninstall operations of the APP.

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
